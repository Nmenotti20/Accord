### Project Description


#### User Story
<<<<<<< Updated upstream
As a Buisiness Owner 
I am looking for a tool to connect me with other buisnesses with capabilities to generate new clients and buisness partners in related industries
so that I may do buisness with them.

=======
As a user, I want to be able to view create and track daily workouts. I want to be able to log multiple exercises in a workout on a given day. I should also be able to track the name, type, weight, sets, reps, and duration of exercise. If the exercise is a cardio exercise, I should be able to track my distance traveled.
